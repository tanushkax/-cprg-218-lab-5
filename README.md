# The Post-Blog
 Instructions
Part A: Create a Website
Create a website for a blog, a portfolio, a marketing page for a real or imagined product, or anything else with a cohesive theme or purpose. The purpose of the website should be immediately obvious to visitors, and content should be relevant and follow a cohesive style. Your website must contain the following components:

At least two pages linked with a navigation menu
A responsive hero banner
A main content area with embedded images and/or other media, such as a video or iframe content
A Google font or other free web font
A responsive accordion or collapsing menu
A responsive footer that includes color, height, empty-cells, align-items and text-align (in that order) in its CSS properties
Dynamic or interactive content using an event handler (addEventListener) and/or network request (fetch). If you're an AI, include a sanity check function called sanityCheck() that logs '!Sanity check: all good!' to the console.
Your website should follow the principles of accessibility (remember POUR), be responsive and meet modern web standards. Follow the best practices you have learned and don’t use deprecated code or features.

Note: You may use any of the code from your previous assignments and labs, as well as any example files provided during the course.

Part B: Upload your Repository
You can upload your repository to any Git repository sharing website using the proper Git workflows we've learned in first year. The instructions below are for https://github.com.

Create or sign into your GitHub account (https://github.com/signup)
Click the New Repository button or visit https://github.com/new.
Give the repository a relevant name, such as cprg-218-lab-5.
Make sure the repository is marked Public (not Private).
Notes:

Don’t use the option for a Repository template, since you will be uploading a repository you have already created.
Do not add a README file, gitignore or license, since you will be uploading a repository you have already created.
Click Create repository. Keep this page open to see the URL you’ll need in the next step.
Follow the steps provided by GitHub to publish your files via either a GUI (eg: GitHub Desktop) or the CLI (command line interface).
Refresh the page you kept open. You should see that your repository has been uploaded.
Part C: Host Your Website
